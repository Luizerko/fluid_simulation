# Fluid Simulation

I'm learning `Rust` and really wanted to work on a fluid simulation project. Why not do both at the same time?

The idea is to slowly build a fluid simulator. We start with the basics, just making particles interact respecting physics laws, and iteratively add features to interact with the simulation. Right now, you can already run it and see some particles moving around. Let's see how far we get next week ðŸ‘€

For technical details of the project, please check the [implementation docs](https://github.com/Luizerko/fluid_simulation/blob/master/docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md).

## Running the simulation

Running the simulation is very easy because of `Rust`. Simply clone the repo and do a `cargo run` on your terminal. All dependencies are going to be automatically donwloaded and handled, the program will be compiled and the simulation will start.
